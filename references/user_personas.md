# User Personas
Our client engagement dashboard is intended for internal users to self serve key growth metrics. Here we define a 3 hypothetical user personas to guide our dashboard development and determine metrics to support their decision-making.

|----------------------------|-----------|------|------|
| Goals and Responsibilities |
| Pain Points and Challenges |
| Information Needs          |
| Key Metrics                |

**Business context**
- User personas (?) - basically assumptions about the potential end users and what their goals, objectives and potential challenges are
  - look through heymax + see what departments you can find
  - else look at the org chart for other online sites (e.g. airbnb) to search for potential departments which we can serve
- metrics + how they support these user personas
- want to be able to split metrics based on user platform / country to understand
